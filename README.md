# Data-Science-Projects  

Analytics Vidhya has a blog post on '24 Ultimate Data Science Projects' (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/). I believe this is a good start to boost my data science skills and hence this repository is a collection of 'my version' of all the 24 dataset analysis.
  
The projects are divided into 3 levels:  
1. Beginner  
2. Intermediate  
3. Advanced  

I will keep adding the the names of completed projects under the above category.
